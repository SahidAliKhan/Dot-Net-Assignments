﻿Unsafe Code/Unmanaged Code
---------------------------

safe code -----the code compiled by .NET CLR. Also called as managed code.
The CLR is responsible for all the background tasks like memory managment,
allocation and deallocation of items on the stack etc.


Unsafe code means a part of the program that executes outside the control 
of the CLR(Common Language Runtime) of the .NET framework.
All tasks need to be taken care by the programmer.
To mark the unsafe code, we use unsafe block.
there is a security risk in  unsafe code.

What all can be made unsafe?
1) Code blocks
2) Methods
3) types
4) Class 
5) Struct

All code that requires pointers is to be made ""unsafe".
If native methods of WindowsOS.

----------
RCW---> Runtime Callable Wrapper.---- wrapper object generated by the CLR
to encapsulate a component object model object for exposing .NET Assembly.
